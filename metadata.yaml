description: Travel back in time to the midst of Civil War-torn America and get a
  first-hand glimpse into how progressive American thinkers were conceptualizing race
  relations and grappling with the issue of how African-Americans would fare in the
  aftermath of the war. This thought-provoking essay from writer and pastor William
  Aikman is a compelling document of a turbulent period in U.S. history.
